        <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>
        <p>For the vast majority of returns, it takes about 5-10 Business Days for us to get your package at the
            fulfillment center, inspect your return, process it into inventory, and complete your refund. If the refund
            is being issued to a credit card, depending on your credit card company, it may take an additional 2-10
            Business Days after your credit is applied for it to post to your account.</p>

        <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>
        <p>No. We do not do back orders. If an item is out of stock the Eshop Customer Loyalty Team will notify you as
            soon as possible and ask if you would like a replacement item. Out of stock orders will be cancelled unless
            a replacement item is requested.</p>

        <abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr>
        <p>Unfortunately, Eshop does not know if an item will go on sale or be marked down until it actually
            happens. </p>
